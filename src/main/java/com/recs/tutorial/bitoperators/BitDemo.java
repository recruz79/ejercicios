//The unary bitwise complement operator "~" inverts a bit pattern; it can be applied to any of the integral types, 
//making every "0" a "1" and every "1" a "0". For example, a byte contains 8 bits; applying this operator to a value
//whose bit pattern is "00000000" would change its pattern to "11111111".
//The signed left shift operator "<<" shifts a bit pattern to the left, and the signed right shift operator ">>"
//shifts a bit pattern to the right. The bit pattern is given by the left-hand operand, and the number of positions
//to shift by the right-hand operand. The unsigned right shift operator ">>>" shifts a zero into the leftmost 
//position, while the leftmost position after ">>" depends on sign extension.

//	The bitwise & operator performs a bitwise AND operation.
//	The bitwise ^ operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.
//	The bitwise | operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation.
//	The following program, BitDemo, uses the bitwise AND operator to print the number "2" to standard output.

//int i = 10;
//int n = i++%5;
//Question: What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
//Answer: i is 11, and n is 0.
//Question: What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?
//Answer: i is 11, and n is 1.

class BitDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int bitmask = 0x000F;
		int val = 0x2222;
		// prints "2"
		System.out.println(val & bitmask);
